                                    To anyone who is thinking about a working visa in Canada, heading to a ski hill to work or hit the slopes is a must! Within two weeks of arriving in Canada, I was living on a ski hill, <a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/"

                                    and wanting to have a good time. You get to meet people from all over the world as you learn all the exicitings things about ski hill life together. If you've never skiied or snowboarded before that's no problem as
                                    chances are, you are going to be living with some people who have never seen snow before! I'd personally never snowboarded before so thought a winter season was the best time, there's still room for improvement but
                                    I'm not totally useless now! The staff accommodation was a great experience as I made friends quickly, since you are all sleeping and eating in the same place, and all working on the same hill. You quickly get to recognise
                                    most people on the hill both in normal clothes and wrapped up in their ski gear. There are a variety of jobs you would be able to do while working on a ski hill that give you plenty of time to hit the slopes or hang
                                    out with friends in your free time. If this is something you'd want to do, just be prepared that it can get as cold as -30 degrees Celius and beyond! One slightly less exciting thing to note about a winter season is

                                    If you're not a fan of the snow and the cold then you will love summer in Canada. It's difficult to know where to go in Canada as when the sun comes out there is so many beauitful, postcard picture landscapes around. Whilst Canada is a huge country with
                                    a lot to see it is possible to get around with greyhound bus when you need, or flying when you feel it's just too far. Out towards the East you have the exciting city of Toronto, amazing views at Niagara Falls, as well
                                    as French-Canadian Quebec to explore. If mountains and lakes are more your thing, you could spend an incredible Summer in the Canadian Rockies, in places like Banff or Jasper. I spent a summer there and everyday the

                                    Vancouver which is a good location for seeing some amazing mountains and beaches. Further across still is Vancouver Island which has a nice chilled out feeling, and is host to activities such as whale watching in the
                                    right season, long hikes along the coast and well known for attracting the surf crowd to Tofino. You're not really going to go wrong wherever you spend your summer in Canada, you just want to put a bit of research in
                                    to decide what sort places you'd like to see and what you'd like to do.
