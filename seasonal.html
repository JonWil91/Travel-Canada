                                    most people on the hill both in normal clothes and wrapped up in their ski gear! There are a variety of jobs you would be able to do while working on a ski hill that give you plenty of time to hits the slopes or hang
                                    out with friends in your free time. If this is something you'd want to do, just be prepared that it can get as cold as -30 degrees Celius and beyond! One slightly less exciting thing to note about a winter season is
