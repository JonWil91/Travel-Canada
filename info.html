                            <h4>Starting the exciting process</h4>
                            <p>The first step is to head to your own countries <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/canada/entry-requirements" target="_blank">Government Website</a>, search for working holiday visas and investigate what forms
                                you need to read and fill in for your choice of country. There will be a lot of paperwork with this application but it is worth it!</p>

                        <div class="timeline-item">
                            <h4>Working holiday companies</h4>
                            <p>This is an optional next step but it can definitely help people who have never done anything like this before, hence the reason I used
                                <a href="https://www.theworkingholidayclub.com/canada/" target="_blank">The Working Holiday Club</a>. These companies can help arrange the all important first job for when you arrive in Canada, as well as providing support
                                and encouragement along the way, and in some cases they can also assist in the visa application process.</p>

                            <h4>Insurance</h4>
                            <p>Insurance is arguably one of the most important things to think about before thinking about working and living abroad, especially in a winter season where the risk of injury is significantly higher. One thing to be aware of
                                is that even if you're insured the hospital may insist on at least the doctors fee for admission, as long as you keep a record of receipts and paperwork you can add it to your claim. I personally used <a href="https://www.travelcounsellors.co.uk/gb/leisure"
                                    target="_blank">Travel Counsellors</a> and was looked after.</p>

                            <h4>Country and culture</h4>
                            <p>One of the first things you are going to learn once you arrive in Canada is that, like America, tipping is part of their culture. If you want to integrate yourself properly into a new country you need to be aware of these little
                                details. Standard practice is to tip 15.00% for good service (this is an expected addition to the bill) or 20.00% for great service. At the bar, if you're paying by the round, you want to be adding a $1.00 per drink at
                                least. You want the barman of all people to be your friend!</p>

                                <h3>The Wildlife</h3>
                                <p>One important thing about exploring the beauitful trails in Canada is being aware of the wildlife and staying safe. Check out <a href="https://www.canadianaffair.com/blog/safely-responsibly-watch-wildlife-canada/" target="_blank">Canadian Affair</a>                                for more information.

                                <h3>The Food</h3>
                                <p>A staple snack/meal in Canada is the poutine, this is chips, gravy and melted cheese curds. It may not sound like much but
                                when you've tried the variations of the dish around the country you'll wonder how you lived without it.

                                <h3>The Culture</h3>
                                <p>You will find that one brilliant stereotype that Canada does a great job in living up to is that of being polite and friendly</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="my-3">
                                <h3>The Long Distances</h3>
                                <p>If you are coming from somewhere like the UK like I did when first visiting Canada, you may find that everything can be quite spread out,
                                and it takes a long time to get from place to place. From personal experience this is something I belive you naturally get used to and a 6 hour bus
                                journey will suddenly feel like the norm!</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>The Currency</h3>
                                <p>The $1.00 and $2.00 coins in Canada are the Looney and Tooney. I felt this warranted it's own section as I believe it's the best named currency out there.
